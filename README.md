Azure :Export the List of all Azure VM Images List in to CSV or in HTML Format
==============================================================================

            

If you are working on Microsoft Azure, the one thing which all do all the time is, running the Get-AzureVMImage cmdlet time to time, to get the list of all OS images. It's a tiresome job if you need to find all of them and then
 select a single one, you have to write a code if you need a single image. to solve it, I have write a fucntion.  You just need to run the script and it will generate a HTML page by default in your temp directory, containing the name, label and size of
 all OS images avaiable.


If you want to generate a CSV file, then just use the -CSV switch with the function and it will generate a csv file only To know more about it, please see my below blog post.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
